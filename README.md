# Development

1. Clone the repository

2. Set up [MongoDB locally](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use a [cloud provider](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.default` file in the repository
```
port=80
mongo_uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
mongo_name='duel-masters'
restart_after=
```

5. Build the webapp<br>
`cd webapp`<br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run build`<br>
or<br>
`npm run watch` to rebuild every time a change is made

6. Run the application. If you're using vscode simply press `F5` or `Run -> Start Debugging`. To run manually use `go run cmd/duel-masters/main.go`. Note that debugging with vscode will automatically pick up environment variables from the `.env` file. If you're not using vscode's debug mode or if you are using a different editor you will have to make sure the necessary environment variables are set.

7. Navigate to `http://localhost` and create a user as well as a deck. To set the deck as a standard deck, find it in the database and change the `standard` field to `true`.
